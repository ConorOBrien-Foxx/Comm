# Comm
_A language in which functions are implemented by you, the user._

## What is Comm?
Comm is a stack-based programming language whose commands are defined be the people (you!). I start it off with basic commands; from there, you can open up an issue in this repository suggesting a command and its functionality, along with which character you request your function to be assigned to. This character does not have to be on the list, but I will start off with the printable ASCII (from ` ` (a space) to `~`) then proceed to two-or-more-byte characters. 

The interpreter is currently a work-in-progress.

## What commands are there?
Look no further:

    CHARACTER | CONTRIBUTOR | FUNCTION
    <space>   | self        | NO-OP
    !         | self        | Push next character to the stack
    "         | self        | Push characters to the stack until an unescpaed " is met
    #         | self        | Switch top two entities on the stack
    $         | self        | Pop the top element of the stack and output it
    %         | self        | Pops B then A and pushes A mod B
    &         | unnasigned  | --
    '         | unassigned  | --
    (         | self        | Begins a while loop
    )         | self        | Jumps to matching ( if the top of the stack is nonzero; otherwise proceeds
    *         | self        | Pops B then A and pushes AB (that is, A*B)
    +         | self        | Pops B then A and pushes A+B

    -         | self        | Pops B then A and pushes A-B

    /         | self        | Pops B then A and pushes A/B
    0-9       | self        | Push a numeric literal to the stack
