# Comm
_A language in which functions are implemented by you, the user._

## What is Comm?
Comm is a stack-based programming language whose commands are defined by the people (you!). I start it off with basic commands; from there, you can open up an issue in this repository suggesting a command and its functionality, along with which character you request your function to be assigned to. This character does not have to be on the list, but I will start off with the printable ASCII (from ` ` (a space) to `~`) then proceed to two-or-more-byte characters. 

The interpreter is currently a work-in-progress.

## Input and Output methods
Input is "fed" to the program before execution, as all input is laid on the stack initially. After termination, the top item on the stack, if any, is outputted.

## What commands are there?
As of 13:29 11/19/15, Comm supports a multi-paradigm operating. Thus, each paradigm has it's own set of characters.

### Stack-based commands

    CHARACTER | CONTRIBUTOR | FUNCTION
    <space>   | self        | NO-OP
    !         | self        | Push next character to the stack
    "         | self        | Push characters to the stack until an unescpaed " is met
    #         | self        | Switch top two entities on the stack
    $         | self        | Pop the top element of the stack and output it
    %         | self        | Pops B then A and pushes A mod B
    &         | unnasigned  | --
    '         | unassigned  | --
    (         | self        | Begins a while loop
    )         | self        | Jumps to matching ( if the top of the stack is nonzero; otherwise proceeds
    *         | self        | Pops B then A and pushes AB (that is, A*B)
    +         | self        | Pops B then A and pushes A+B
